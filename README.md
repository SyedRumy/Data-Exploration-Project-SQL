Data Exploration Project: "Second-Hand Car Dealer"

Description: This SQL-based project analyzes a dataset of second-hand cars, focusing on key metrics like availability by year, fuel type distributions, and car counts over various time periods. The project provides insights based on stakeholder requests, such as counts of cars by year, fuel type, and records from specific periods.

SCHEMA CREATION:
Before running any of the queries, ensure you create the cars schema and use it in your SQL environment:

CREATE SCHEMA cars;
USE cars;
The project assumes a table secondhand_cars is populated with appropriate data.

QUERIES OVERVIEW:
This project addresses several stakeholder tasks:

Task #1: Total count of cars available.
  - COUNT(*) query to get the total number of cars.

Task #2: Number of cars available in 2023.
  - Query filtered by year 2023.

Task #3: Cars available for 2020, 2021, and 2022, both individually and with a GROUP BY query.

Task #4: Total cars by year, sorted to show which year had the most and least cars.

Task #5: Number of diesel cars in 2020.

Task #6: Number of petrol cars in 2020.

Task #7: Breakdown of cars by fuel type (Petrol, Diesel, CNG) across all years.
